# Simple Searchable Dropdown
## Introduction
I just wanted to build with my own hands a custom dropdown with a search text field. Zero Frameworks. Just Code. The objective is to test my skills and me.

The code is not perfect but is a start.
## Ok, so what's next?
The next step is to transform this code into a Component to be reused, I'm not so sure how to make a Web Component but I still researching. 

In my mind, that mustn't depend on any Framework.
